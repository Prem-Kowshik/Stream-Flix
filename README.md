## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

| Tool     | Purpose                                       | Installation Guide                                       |
| :------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Git**  | For cloning the repository.                   | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)             |
| **Python** | To run the application (v3.9+ recommended).   | [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)          |
| **FFmpeg** | **(Critical)** For audio extraction by Whisper. | [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) (See instructions below) |

**Installing FFmpeg:**
- **Windows (Recommended):** Open PowerShell as Administrator and run `choco install ffmpeg`.
- **macOS (Homebrew):** In your terminal, run `brew install ffmpeg`.
- **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):** In your terminal, run `sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg`.

### 2. Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://gitlab.com/your-username/your-project.git
    cd your-project
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # Create the environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate on Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # Activate on macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your OpenAI API Key:**
    The AI Movie Analysis feature requires an OpenAI API key.
    -   Get your key from the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/).
    -   Set it as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`. The application will read this variable automatically.

### 3. Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, run the following command from the project's root directory:

```bash
streamlit run 00_Browse_Videos.py
